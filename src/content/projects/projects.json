In addition to standard company profile sections, the site includes a shop page where visitors can browse products and easily connect to e-commerce platforms or initiate purchases via WhatsApp.\n\nThe project was built entirely by myself from design and development to testing, deployment, and infrastructure setup — including hosting, domain configuration, and company email. The frontend is built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, delivering a fast and responsive user experience.\n\nTo support dynamic content, I developed a custom content management system using Strapi, Node.js, and MySQL. This CMS allows the client to manage pages, product listings, SEO settings, and user roles, providing full control over their site without technical involvement.",

    "description": "Hoteely is a comprehensive SaaS platform for property management, designed to serve hotel owners, property managers, and staff with an all-in-one solution for managing bookings, operations, and revenue. The system includes a custom-built booking engine that integrates seamlessly with popular reservation sources like Booking.com, Agoda, and more, allowing users to manage reservations across multiple channels from a single interface.\n\nThe platform is divided into two core systems: a frontend application for end users and a backend system for internal developers. On the frontend, users can manage multiple properties with features such as tax and policy configuration, room type and inventory management, rate and promotion controls, availability calendars, and staff assignments. It also includes robust modules for billing and invoicing, as well as user and role management to tailor access levels across teams.\n\nThe backend system is used for internal administration and configuration. It provides control over global app settings such as supported languages, feature toggles, and subscription management, enabling a modular approach to platform customization.\n\nI led the frontend development team, working closely with UI/UX designers, backend developers, and QA engineers. I was also responsible for creating a shared component design system using Bit, which helped streamline development, enforce consistency, and improve team collaboration. The frontend was built using TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Sass, ensuring a performant and scalable architecture. Throughout the project, I collaborated with a diverse, multinational team, contributing to a highly communicative and culturally rich development environment.",
